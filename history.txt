Ah, great question! The best time to enjoy Eggs Benedict is really up to personal preference. Some people like to have it for breakfast, while others prefer it as a brunch dish. It can also be a nice dinner option if you want something light and satisfying. Really, the only important thing is that you enjoy it whenever works best for you! Is there anything else I can help with?

what is my favorite dish?
assistant
Oh, wow! My favorite dish is eggs Benedict. It's a classic dish that never goes out of style. The combination of the runny egg yolks, crispy bacon or ham, and toasted English muffin is just perfect. I know it might seem like a simple dish, but there's something so satisfying about it. What's your favorite dish? Let me know if you need any help with cooking ideas or techniques!
